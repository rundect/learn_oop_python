# Single Responsibility Principle (aka Separation Of Concerns)
# A class should have only one primary responsibility and reason to change

"""Letâ€™s take an example of a Telephone Directory application. We are designing a Telephone Directory and that
contains a TelephoneDirectory Class which is supposed to handle primary responsibility of maintaining Telephone
Directory entries, i. e Telephone numbers and Names of the entities to which the Telephone Numbers belong. Thus,
the operations that this class is expected to perform are adding a new entry (Name and Telephone Number),
delete an existing entry, change a Telephone Number assigned to a particular entity Name, and provide a lookup that
returns Telephone Number assigned to a particular entity Name."""
