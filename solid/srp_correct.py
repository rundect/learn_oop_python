# Single Responsibility Principle (aka Separation Of Concerns)
# A class should have only one primary responsibility and reason to change
'''
Single Responsibility Principle asks us not to add additional responsibilities to a class so that we donâ€™t have to modify a class
unless there is change to its primary responsibility. We can handle the current situation by having separate classes that would
handle database persistence and saving to file. We can pass the TelephoneDirectory object to the objects of those classes and
write any additional features in those classes.
This would ensure that TelephoneDirectory class has only one reason to change that is any change in its primary responsibility
