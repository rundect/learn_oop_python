# Open - Close Principle
# Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification
'''
As shown in this example we have now a very simple base class DiscountCalculator that has a single abstract method get_discounted_price.
We have created new classes for apparels that extends the base DiscountCalculator class. Hence now every sub class would need to
implement the discount part on itself. By doing this we have now removed the previous constraints that required modification to the
base class. Now without modifying the base class we can add more apparels as well as we can change discount amount of an individual
apparel as needed.
